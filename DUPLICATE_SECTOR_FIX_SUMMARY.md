# Duplicate Sector Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Description

In the sector context card's correlation analysis, sectors like "Infrastructure" and "Media" were appearing multiple times with **different correlation values**. This was causing confusion in the UI and incorrect data representation.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Correlation Pair Processing Issue
The issue was in how the frontend processed correlation pairs from the backend. The backend generates correlation pairs like:

```javascript
// Example correlation pairs
[
  {sector1: "INFRASTRUCTURE", sector2: "BANKING", correlation: 0.75},
  {sector1: "INFRASTRUCTURE", sector2: "IT", correlation: 0.82},
  {sector1: "MEDIA", sector2: "BANKING", correlation: 0.68},
  {sector1: "MEDIA", sector2: "IT", correlation: 0.71}
]
```

### 2. Frontend Processing Problem
When the current stock is in the "BANKING" sector, the frontend logic was:
1. Processing each pair to find the "other" sector
2. From Pair 1: `INFRASTRUCTURE` gets added with correlation `0.75`
3. From Pair 2: `INFRASTRUCTURE` gets added with correlation `0.82`
4. From Pair 3: `MEDIA` gets added with correlation `0.68`
5. From Pair 4: `MEDIA` gets added with correlation `0.71`

This resulted in the same sector appearing multiple times with different correlation values.

### 3. Inadequate Deduplication
The original deduplication logic used a simple Set to track seen sectors, but it only kept the **first occurrence** of each sector, ignoring potentially more significant correlation values.

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend Fix: Enhanced Correlation Processing

Modified the correlation processing logic in `frontend/src/pages/NewOutput.tsx` to use a Map-based approach that keeps the **most significant correlation value** for each sector:

#### A. High Correlation Sectors
```typescript
high_correlation_sectors: (() => {
  const pairs = backendSectorContext.sector_correlation?.high_correlation_pairs || [];
  const sectorMap = new Map(); // Use Map to track highest correlation per sector
  
  pairs.forEach((p: any) => {
    const sector = p.sector1 === backendSectorContext.sector ? p.sector2 : p.sector1;
    const correlation = p.correlation;
    
    // Keep the highest correlation value for each sector
    if (!sectorMap.has(sector) || sectorMap.get(sector).correlation < correlation) {
      sectorMap.set(sector, { sector, correlation });
    }
  });
  
  return Array.from(sectorMap.values());
})(),
```

#### B. Low Correlation Sectors
```typescript
low_correlation_sectors: (() => {
  const pairs = backendSectorContext.sector_correlation?.low_correlation_pairs || [];
  const sectorMap = new Map(); // Use Map to track lowest correlation per sector
  
  pairs.forEach((p: any) => {
    const sector = p.sector1 === backendSectorContext.sector ? p.sector2 : p.sector1;
    const correlation = p.correlation;
    
    // Keep the lowest correlation value for each sector (for low correlation sectors)
    if (!sectorMap.has(sector) || sectorMap.get(sector).correlation > correlation) {
      sectorMap.set(sector, { sector, correlation });
    }
  });
  
  return Array.from(sectorMap.values());
})()
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Map-based Deduplication**: Uses a Map instead of a Set to track correlation values
2. **Highest Correlation for High Correlation Sectors**: Keeps the highest correlation value for sectors in the high correlation list
3. **Lowest Correlation for Low Correlation Sectors**: Keeps the lowest correlation value for sectors in the low correlation list
4. **Proper Data Structure**: Returns an array of objects with sector and correlation properties

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/pages/NewOutput.tsx**
   - Enhanced `transformSectorContext()` function
   - Improved correlation processing logic for both high and low correlation sectors
   - Implemented Map-based deduplication with value tracking

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify No Duplicates**: Check that each sector appears only once in correlation analysis
2. **Verify Correct Values**: Ensure that the correlation values shown are the most significant ones
3. **Test Different Sectors**: Test with stocks from different sectors to ensure the logic works universally
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with sectors that have multiple correlation pairs

## Impact

- **Positive**: Eliminates duplicate sector entries in correlation analysis
- **Positive**: Shows the most significant correlation value for each sector
- **Positive**: Improves data accuracy and user experience
- **Positive**: More robust logic prevents future similar issues
- **Neutral**: No performance impact as processing is done in memory

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use Map-based deduplication when dealing with key-value pairs
2. Consider the significance of values when deduplicating (highest/lowest as appropriate)
3. Add validation checks for correlation data processing
4. Consider adding unit tests for correlation data transformation
