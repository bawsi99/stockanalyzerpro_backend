While the overall trend remains strong and bullish, these short-term indicators suggest a possible consolidation or minor retracement before resuming the upward trajectory, or a test of the long-term resistance.", "chart_insights": "**Comprehensive Technical Overview:**\nHere's a comprehensive technical analysis of Wipro based on the provided multi-panel chart:\n\n**Overall Trend:**\nThe stock experienced a strong **bullish trend** from June 2024 to late December 2024, followed by a sharp **bearish reversal** and significant downtrend until late April 2025. Since late April/early May 2025, the price has been in a **recovery phase**, currently attempting to establish a new **short-term bullish trend** but facing significant overhead resistance.\n\n**Volume Analysis:**\n*   During the initial uptrend (late 2024), volume was generally robust, with OBV confirming accumulation.\n*   The sharp downtrend (early 2025) was accompanied by substantial volume, confirming distribution and selling pressure.\n*   In the current recovery phase (since late April 2025), volume has been picking up on green days, and the **OBV (normalized) is trending upwards**, validating the recent price rebound and indicating increasing buying interest. However, current volume levels are moderate and not exceptionally high, suggesting the upward movement might need stronger volume to sustain a major breakout.\n\n**Momentum Assessment:**\n*   **MACD (12, 26):** The MACD line has decisively crossed above its Signal (9) line and has moved above the zero line. The MACD histogram is also positive and expanding, indicating strong **bullish momentum** and a clear buy signal. This is a very positive development after a prolonged period in bearish territory.\n*   **RSI (14):** RSI has moved up from oversold territory (below 30 in late April) and is currently around the 55-60 mark. It is above the neutral 50 level, confirming **bullish momentum** and indicating there is still **room for further upside** before reaching overbought conditions (above 70).\n*   **Stochastic Oscillator (%K, %D):** The Stochastic has also risen from oversold levels. Currently, both %K and %D are in the mid-to-upper range (around 60-70). While it has recently shown a slight dip from near overbought levels, it's not yet signaling an immediate strong reversal. It generally confirms the short-term upward momentum but suggests a potential for consolidation or a minor pullback.\n\n**Trend Strength:**\n*   **ADX:** ADX is currently around 25-30, indicating a **moderately strong trend**. The **+DI line is above the -DI line**, confirming the current directional movement is bullish. While ADX had a strong trend in the earlier uptrend and subsequent downtrend, its current level suggests the recovery trend is present but not yet parabolic. The ADX line itself has dipped slightly from its recent peak, indicating that the *strength* of the current short-term leg of the uptrend might be consolidating.\n\n**Key Levels:**\n*   **Immediate Resistance:** The SMA 200 (purple line) around **275-280** is acting as significant overhead resistance. The upper Bollinger Band is also converging near this level. Previous highs around 280-285 from January 2025 are also a resistance zone.\n*   **Immediate Support:** The SMA 20 (blue line) around **260-265** and the SMA 50 (orange line) around **255-260** are acting as dynamic support levels.\n*   **Strong Support:** The swing low around **240** is a critical support zone, representing the bottom of the recent downtrend.\n\n**Signal Confluence:**\n*   **Bullish Alignment:**\n    *   **Price action:** Price is trading above both SMA 20 and SMA 50.\n    *   **Moving Averages:** A **bullish cross (golden cross for short-term)** where SMA 20 has crossed above SMA 50 has recently occurred, indicating a shift in short-to-medium term trend.\n    *   **MACD:** Strong bullish cross and positive values, confirming upward momentum.\n    *   **RSI:** Above 50, indicating bullish momentum and room for growth.\n    *   **OBV:** Rising, confirming accumulation and buying interest.\n    *   **ADX:** +DI is above -DI, confirming bullish direction.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n*   **Overhead Resistance:** The most significant risk is the strong resistance at the SMA 200 level (275-280). The stock has struggled to break this level. A failure to break above it with conviction could lead to a retracement.\n*   **Volume Confirmation:** While OBV is good, a massive surge in volume during the break of SMA 200 would provide stronger confirmation. Current volume is moderate.\n*   **Stochastic Overextension:** While not fully overbought, the Stochastic's slight downturn from near-overbought indicates a potential for a short-term pause or pullback.\n\n**Trading Implications:**\n*   Wipro is showing clear signs of a **reversal and potential new uptrend** after a significant decline.\n*   **Aggressive traders** might consider an entry on a confirmed break above the SMA 200 (around 275-280) with strong volume, targeting previous highs around 300+. A stop-loss could be placed below SMA 50.\n*   **Conservative traders** might wait for a successful breakout above SMA 200 and a retest of this level as support, or look for a pullback to the SMA 50 (around 255-260) for a lower-risk entry, provided the bullish signals (MACD, RSI, OBV) remain intact.\n*   The current market phase suggests a shift from bearish to consolidating/bullish, but the next few candles around the SMA 200 resistance will be crucial.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n**Medium-High.**\n*   **Reasoning for Medium-High:** The confluence of bullish signals from MACD (strongest signal), RSI, a bullish MA cross (SMA 20 over SMA 50), and rising OBV are compelling and suggest a strong chance of continued upside. The ADX also confirms a directional trend.\n*   **Reasons for not High:** The price is directly at a major resistance level (SMA 200), and the overall volume is good but not exceptionally high for a confirmed major breakout. The prior strong downtrend also means this recovery needs solid confirmation to be considered a sustained new uptrend. A failure to clear 280 could lead to a retest of lower support levels.\n\n**Comprehensive Volume Analysis:**\nAs an expert volume analyst, I've thoroughly examined the provided Wipro volume charts. My analysis focuses on volume anomalies, price-volume correlation, candlestick volume patterns, and their implications for understanding market dynamics and potential trading signals.\n\n---\n\n**Volume Anomalies:**\nThe Volume Anomalies chart clearly highlights periods of unusually high trading activity, significantly above the 20-day moving average and often exceeding 2x normal volume.\n*   **Late July - Early August 2024:** Two initial anomalies occurred as the price consolidated and began a slight downtrend from its initial rally. The first, a very high spike, coincided with a significant red candle (from the Candlestick chart), suggesting strong selling pressure or profit-taking after an initial price surge. The subsequent anomaly in early August, though smaller, still marked a period of heightened activity during price stabilization.\n*   **Late September 2024:** A couple of smaller anomalies as price was in a consolidation phase.\n*   **Early November 2024:** A massive volume spike, one of the largest on the chart, occurred as the stock was breaking out of a consolidation phase and initiating a strong uptrend. This signals strong buying interest and conviction behind the new upward move.\n*   **Late January - Early February 2025:** A cluster of anomalies, including a very high spike, occurred when the price reached its peak around 310-320. This suggests a significant battle between buyers and sellers, often indicative of distribution or exhaustion at a market top. Looking at the candlestick chart, these coincide with volatile sessions including large red and green candles, confirming indecision and high turnover.\n*   **Late April - Early May 2025:** A significant volume spike appeared when the price reached its trough around 240. This anomaly coincides with a large green candle on the candlestick chart, strongly suggesting capitulation selling followed by aggressive buying, likely marking a significant bottom or accumulation phase.\n*   **Mid-June 2025:** A smaller anomaly during the ongoing recovery, indicating pockets of renewed interest.\n\n**Price-Volume Correlation:**\nThe 20-day Price-Volume Correlation chart provides critical insights into the relationship strength and direction between price movements and volume.\n*   **Mid-2024 (July-October):** The correlation was generally positive but moderate (mostly between 0.25 and 0.50), indicating some buying interest on price increases.\n*   **Late 2024 - Early 2025 (October - February):** The correlation turned strongly positive, ranging from 0.50 to nearly 0.75, confirming the robust uptrend. This period showed increasing volume accompanying rising prices, which is a healthy sign for a sustained bull run.\n*   **Early 2025 (February - April):** A dramatic shift to strong negative correlation, dropping to as low as -0.75, occurred during the sharp price decline. This indicates that falling prices were accompanied by increasing volume, confirming strong selling pressure and a conviction behind the bearish move.\n*   **Mid-2025 (April - July):** The correlation has swung back to strongly positive, reaching close to 0.75 again, as the price attempts to recover. This confirms renewed buying interest and potential for a continued rebound.\n\n**Volume Trends:**\nThe overall volume trend, indicated by the 20-day MA and raw volume on the lower panel of the candlestick chart, shows a dynamic pattern.\n*   The initial phase (July-October 2024) saw moderate average volume with intermittent spikes.\n*   The strong uptrend from October 2024 to February 2025 was generally accompanied by an increase in the 20-day volume MA, confirming strong participation in the rally.\n*   The subsequent sharp downtrend (February-April 2025) also saw elevated volume, particularly on down days (red candles), indicating significant selling.\n*   The current recovery phase (April-July 2025) has seen volume pick up on green days, and the 20-day MA shows a slight uptick, confirming the current upward price movement with increasing interest.\n*   Overall, the periods of high volatility (both upward and downward) are associated with higher average volumes, while consolidation periods see volume contract.\n\n**Volume Divergences:**\nTrue volume divergences (where price makes a new high/low but volume decreases, or vice-versa) are not prominently sustained throughout the observed period.\n*   **Lack of Bearish Divergence before the Feb 2025 Top:** While the price was making new highs in late Jan/early Feb 2025, the correlation remained strongly positive, and significant volume anomalies were present. This indicates high activity, rather than waning interest. The high volume at the peak, especially on down days within that period (as seen on candlestick chart), indicates distribution rather than a classic volume divergence.\n*   **Lack of Bullish Divergence before the Apr 2025 Bottom:** The price made a significant low in April 2025, accompanied by a major volume anomaly (capitulation/accumulation). The correlation quickly flipped to positive. This suggests a sharp reversal with conviction, rather than a divergence over time.\nThe market has largely shown volume *confirming* the price trends (strong positive correlation in uptrends, strong negative in downtrends) rather than diverging, which is a sign of strong, fundamental moves.\n\n**Volume-Based Levels:**\n*   **Support at ~240-250:** The massive volume spike in late April 2025 (anomalies chart) directly at the 240 price level, coinciding with the price bottom and the strong positive correlation rebound, firmly establishes this as a significant volume-based support level. This is where strong buying interest emerged.\n*   **Resistance at ~310-320:** The cluster of high volume anomalies and volatile price action in late January/early February 2025 occurred as the price reached its peak. The inability to sustain prices above 320 despite such high volume suggests significant selling or distribution at these levels, establishing this as a strong volume-based resistance zone.\n*   **Intermediate Zone at ~260-270:** This price range saw significant volume activity in late July/August 2024 and then again as resistance in late October 2024 before a breakout. Price has now returned to this zone in the current recovery. This level represents a prior area of contention and could act as either support or resistance depending on future price action and volume.\n\n**Trading Signals:**\n*   **Bullish Reversal (Strong Signal):** The high volume anomaly around 240 in late April 2025, combined with the subsequent strong positive price-volume correlation, provided a clear and strong signal for a potential bullish reversal and accumulation phase.\n*   **Bearish Reversal/Distribution (Strong Signal):** The high volume anomalies and volatile price action at the 310-320 peak in late Jan/early Feb 2025, combined with the subsequent sharp turn to negative price-volume correlation, signaled significant distribution and the likelihood of a major price decline.\n*   **Trend Confirmation (Ongoing):** The current strong positive correlation (since April 2025) indicates that the ongoing price recovery is supported by increasing volume on up days, suggesting the upward momentum is likely to continue as long as this correlation holds.\n*   **Potential Exhaustion:** Should the stock continue to rally towards 270-280 or higher, a significant drop in volume on new highs (a divergence) or a return of high volume on red candles would be a signal of potential exhaustion of the current rally.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n*   **Whipsaws Around Anomalies:** While anomalies are significant, they can sometimes lead to whipsaw movements. For example, high volume at a peak might not immediately result in a breakdown; it could be followed by a retest. Confirmation from subsequent price action and correlation is crucial.\n*   **News-Driven Spikes:** Some volume spikes could be due to news events (earnings, corporate actions) which, while important, might not always reflect organic market sentiment and could lead to short-term volatility rather than sustained trends.\n*   **Lagging Nature of Confirmation:** Volume often confirms price action rather than predicting it far in advance. Waiting for confirmation (e.g., correlation turning strongly positive/negative) can mean missing the very beginning of a move, but it significantly reduces false signals.\n*   **False Bottom/Top:** While the anomalies at the major turning points (240 support, 320 resistance) appear robust, there's always a risk that they are temporary and further price action could break these levels. Subsequent volume patterns are key for validation.\n\n**Confidence Level: High**\nThe provided charts are exceptionally clear and comprehensive. The explicit marking of anomalies, the quantitative representation of volume ratio, and especially the dynamically calculated price-volume correlation provide a robust dataset. This allows for a detailed and well-substantiated analysis of volume behavior across different market phases, confirming trends, identifying reversals, and pinpointing key support/resistance levels with strong conviction.\n\n**Reversal Pattern Analysis:**\nAs an expert reversal pattern analyst, I have meticulously examined the provided charts for WIPRO, focusing on divergences and double tops/bottoms patterns to identify potential trend reversals.\n\n---\n\n**Divergence Analysis:**\n\nThe \"WIPRO Divergences\" chart effectively highlights areas where price action contradicts the indicator's movement, signaling potential weakening of the current trend.\n\n*   **Bearish Divergences (Red Arrows/Dashed Lines):**\n    *   **Late 2024 (around 260-270):** Several instances of regular bearish divergence are observed. Price formed higher highs or relatively equal highs, while the indicator showed lower highs. These initial divergences led to minor pullbacks or periods of consolidation, indicating a weakening of the bullish momentum but not a full reversal. The market digested these signals, but no significant downtrend materialized immediately.\n    *   **Early 2025 (around 315-320):** A very clear and strong **regular bearish divergence** formed at the absolute peak. Price made a new higher high, while the indicator failed to follow, making a distinct lower high. This divergence was significant due to its occurrence at a major high and its pronounced nature.\n\n*   **Bullish Divergences (Green Arrows/Dotted Lines):**\n    *   **Late 2024 (around 250):** A **regular bullish divergence** is visible where price made a lower low, but the indicator made a higher low. This signal preceded a subsequent uptrend, suggesting that selling pressure was waning.\n    *   **April 2025 (around 235-240):** A prominent and robust **regular bullish divergence** occurred at the low point of the significant downtrend. Price made a new lower low, while the indicator exhibited a clear higher low. This divergence indicated strong buying interest accumulating and a potential exhaustion of the selling trend.\n\n**Reversal Patterns:**\n\nThe \"WIPRO Double Tops/Bottoms\" chart clearly marks classic reversal patterns.\n\n*   **Double Tops (Red Triangles):**\n    *   **Late 2024 (around 270):** A potential double top formation is marked. However, the subsequent breakdown below the implied neckline (dashed red line) was shallow, and price quickly recovered, failing to confirm a significant reversal. This serves as an example of a pattern that did not fully mature or confirm.\n    *   **Early 2025 (around 315-320):** A well-defined **double top pattern** formed. Price established two distinct peaks at similar levels, with a clear trough (neckline) between them around 280. The decisive break below this neckline confirmed the pattern, leading to a substantial decline.\n\n*   **Double Bottoms (Green Triangles):**\n    *   **Late 2024 (around 255):** A clear **double bottom pattern** emerged. Price formed two troughs at comparable levels, with a peak (neckline) around 265. The subsequent breakout above this neckline confirmed the pattern, preceding an uptrend.\n    *   **April 2025 (around 235-240):** A textbook **double bottom pattern** formed at the end of the steep downtrend. Price established two distinct troughs at similar levels, with a neckline around 245-250. The strong breakout above this neckline provided clear confirmation of a bullish reversal.\n\n**Pattern Confluence:**\n\nThe most reliable reversal signals occur when multiple analytical techniques point in the same direction.\n\n*   **Major Bearish Reversal (Feb 2025):** This period exhibits exceptional confluence. The strong **regular bearish divergence** observed at the peak in the divergence chart perfectly aligns with the formation of the **double top pattern** on the reversal patterns chart. This dual confirmation at a critical price level significantly amplified the reliability of the bearish reversal signal, leading to a substantial downtrend.\n*   **Major Bullish Reversal (April 2025):** Similarly, at the bottom of the significant downtrend, there is strong confluence. The pronounced **regular bullish divergence** on the divergence chart perfectly coincides with the formation of a clear **double bottom pattern**. This powerful combination of signals provided a high-probability indication of an impending uptrend.\n*   Other instances of divergences and patterns existed (e.g., late 2024), but their confluence was less strong or the patterns themselves were less decisive, leading to smaller or failed reversals.\n\n**Signal Strength:**\n\nThe major reversal signals (Feb 2025 top and April 2025 bottom) demonstrate **high strength and reliability** due to the textbook formation of both the divergences and the double top/bottom patterns, coupled with their strong confluence. The outcomes (significant trend reversals) further validate their strength. The other, minor patterns or divergences, while potentially useful for short-term trades, carried less strength due to weaker formation or lack of strong confluence. The absence of volume data is a limitation, but assuming typical volume behavior (increasing on breakouts, decreasing on pullbacks), these signals would be even stronger.\n\n**Reversal Points:**\n\n*   **Potential Bearish Reversal Point (Feb 2025):** Around **315-320**. This was the area where the double top formed and the bearish divergence was most pronounced.\n*   **Potential Bullish Reversal Point (April 2025):** Around **235-240**. This was the area where the double bottom formed and the bullish divergence was clearly visible.\n\n**Confirmation Levels:**\n\n*   **Bearish Reversal (Feb 2025):** Confirmation would be a decisive break and close below the **double top neckline at approximately 280**. A retest of this level as resistance would provide further confirmation.\n*   **Bullish Reversal (April 2025):** Confirmation would be a decisive break and close above the **double bottom neckline at approximately 245-250**. A retest of this level as support would provide further confirmation.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n\n*   **Bearish Reversal Trade (Shorting):**\n    *   **Entry:** Upon confirmation, ideally on a clear breakdown below the 280 neckline (e.g., strong bearish candle close below).\n    *   **Stop Loss:** Placed strategically above the higher of the two peaks of the double top, for example, just above 320, or a tighter stop if re-entry is planned after a retest of the neckline (e.g., above 285 if entering on retest).\n    *   **Target:** Measured move of the double top pattern. The height of the pattern is approx. 320 (peak) - 280 (neckline) = 40 points. Projecting this from the neckline breakdown: 280 - 40 = **240**. This target was successfully met, aligning with the subsequent double bottom low.\n*   **Bullish Reversal Trade (Longing):**\n    *   **Entry:** Upon confirmation, ideally on a clear breakout above the 245-250 neckline (e.g., strong bullish candle close above).\n    *   **Stop Loss:** Placed strategically below the lower of the two troughs of the double bottom, for example, just below 235, or a tighter stop if re-entry is planned after a retest of the neckline (e.g., below 240 if entering on retest).\n    *   **Target:** Measured move of the double bottom pattern. The height of the pattern is approx. 250 (neckline) - 235 (trough) = 15 points. Projecting this from the neckline breakout: 250 + 15 = **265**. Price has already surpassed this, indicating further potential upside.\n\n**False Signal Risk:**\n\n*   **Divergences:** Not all divergences lead to significant reversals. Especially minor divergences or those in a strong trend can merely result in consolidation or a brief pullback before the original trend resumes. The early bearish divergences in late 2024 illustrate this; they did not lead to major reversals.\n*   **Double Tops/Bottoms:** These patterns can fail if the neckline is not decisively broken with conviction (e.g., strong volume, clear candle close). False breakouts can occur where price breaks the neckline but quickly reverses back into the pattern's range. The unconfirmed double top in late 2024 is an example.\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   **Confirmation is Key:** Always wait for a clear breakdown/breakout of the neckline for double tops/bottoms. Do not pre-empt the move based on the pattern formation alone.\n    *   **Confluence:** Prioritize signals where multiple independent reversal indicators (like divergence + pattern) align.\n    *   **Volume:** Ideally, look for increased volume on the breakout/breakdown and lower volume on potential retests of the neckline. (Not available here, but crucial in real trading).\n    *   **Timeframe:** Reversal patterns on higher timeframes generally offer more reliable signals than those on lower timeframes.\n    *   **Patience:** Not every pattern or divergence will lead to a successful trade. Be selective and only act on the highest conviction setups.\n\n**Trading Strategy:**\n\nBased on this analysis, an effective strategy involves focusing on high-conviction confluence points:\n\n1.  **Identify Divergences:** Scan charts for regular divergences between price and an oscillator, especially after extended trends.\n2.  **Look for Pattern Confirmation:** Once a divergence is spotted, look for classic reversal patterns (like double tops/bottoms, head and shoulders, etc.) forming at the same area.\n3.  **Wait for Neckline Breakout/Breakdown:** Do not enter until the pattern's neckline is clearly broken and confirmed (e.g., by a strong candle close beyond the level).\n4.  **Confirm with Volume (if available):** Look for increased volume on the breakout/breakdown.\n5.  **Set Stop Loss:** Place stop loss beyond the extreme of the pattern (e.g., above the peaks of a double top, below the troughs of a double bottom).\n6.  **Set Profit Target:** Use the measured move of the pattern as a primary profit target.\n7.  **Monitor Retests:** Often, the price will retest the broken neckline, which can provide a lower-risk entry or an opportunity to add to positions if the retest holds.\n\n**Confidence Level: High**\n\n**Reasoning:** The provided charts offer clear and well-marked examples of both divergences and double top/bottom patterns. Crucially, the analysis demonstrates two excellent instances of strong confluence where a significant divergence directly precedes and complements a well-formed reversal pattern (Feb 2025 top: Bearish Divergence + Double Top; April 2025 bottom: Bullish Divergence + Double Bottom). The subsequent price action perfectly validated these high-probability signals, showcasing the power and reliability of combining these technical analysis tools for identifying significant trend reversals. The patterns are textbook in their formation and outcome, lending high confidence to the analysis.\n\n**Continuation & Level Analysis:**\nAs an expert continuation pattern and level analyst, I have meticulously examined the provided Wipro charts, focusing on trend continuation signals and key price levels.\n\n### **Continuation Patterns:**\n\n1.  **Bearish Flag (February 2025 - April 2025):** The first flag identified is a clear bearish flag pattern. Following a significant downtrend from approximately 320, the price entered a consolidation phase, forming a downward-sloping channel (flag). This pattern typically signals a continuation of the preceding downtrend. The subsequent breakdown from this flag confirmed its bearish implication, leading the price further down to the 240 support level. This pattern demonstrated good reliability.\n\n2.  **Bullish Flag/Ascending Channel (April 2025 - Present):** The second pattern observed is an ascending channel, which in the context of the preceding rebound from 240, acts as a potential bullish flag. After bouncing strongly from the 240 support, the price has been consolidating within an upward-sloping channel. This pattern suggests that the recent upward move is likely to continue once the consolidation resolves. The current price is near the upper boundary of this channel.\n\n### **Key Levels:**\n\n*   **Resistance 1 (Strong): ~315 - 320:** This represents the peak of the rally shown and acted as significant resistance.\n*   **Resistance 2 (Intermediate): ~275:** Historically, this level served as support in late 2024 before becoming a clear resistance after the significant price drop.\n*   **Resistance 3 (Current Critical): ~258 - 260:** This level has historically acted as robust support multiple times in 2024. After the recent sharp decline, it has flipped to become a critical overhead resistance level that the price is currently approaching.\n*   **Support 1 (Current Critical): ~240:** This is a very strong support level. It marked the low point after the bearish flag breakdown and initiated the current rebound. It held firm against multiple attempts to break lower.\n*   **Support 2 (Minor): ~235:** A less significant support level below 240, which would come into play if 240 breaks.\n\n### **Pattern-Level Confluence:**\n\n*   **Bearish Flag Confluence:** The breakdown from the first bearish flag led the price directly to the strong support level of ~240, confirming the pattern's efficacy and the significance of the 240 level as a demand zone.\n*   **Bullish Flag/Ascending Channel Confluence:** The current ascending flag's *upper boundary* is directly coinciding with the strong historical resistance level of **~258 - 260**. This creates a powerful confluence point. A successful breakout above both the flag's upper trendline and the 258-260 horizontal resistance would be a very strong bullish signal. Conversely, a failure to break this confluence could lead to a retest of lower levels within or below the channel. The flag originated from the ~240 strong support.\n\n### **Breakout Potential:**\n\n*   **Bullish Breakout:** The primary potential breakout point is above the **~260** level. This involves breaching both the upper trendline of the current ascending flag/channel and the significant horizontal resistance at 258-260. A successful breakout here would signal a continuation of the rebound from 240.\n*   **Bearish Breakdown:** A breakdown below the lower trendline of the current ascending flag (approximately ~245-248, depending on the exact point of breach) would indicate a failure of the bullish continuation pattern. A more significant bearish breakdown would occur if the price falls below the critical **~240** support level, which could open doors for further downside.\n\n### **Confirmation Signals:**\n\n*   **Volume Confirmation:** A significant surge in trading volume accompanying the breakout above ~260 would provide strong confirmation of the bullish continuation. Similarly, a spike in volume on a breakdown below ~240 would confirm bearish continuation.\n*   **Candlestick Confirmation:** A strong bullish closing candle (e.g., a large body candle) above ~260 that closes definitively outside the pattern and above the resistance level. For a bearish breakdown, a strong bearish closing candle below the pattern and support.\n*   **Retest and Hold:** Price breaking out, then retesting the broken resistance (now support) at ~260 and bouncing off it would provide further confirmation.\n\n### **Entry/Exit Levels:**\n\n*   **Optimal Bullish Entry:**\n    *   **Aggressive:** On a confirmed daily close above 260.\n    *   **Conservative:** On a successful retest of 260 as support after the breakout.\n*   **Optimal Bearish Entry (if bullish fails):**\n    *   **Aggressive:** On a confirmed daily close below the lower trendline of the ascending flag (~245-248).\n    *   **Conservative:** On a confirmed daily close below 240 support.\n\n### **Risk Management:**\n\n*   **Stop Loss (Bullish Trade):**\n    *   Place stop-loss initially just below the 250 level (mid-point of the current consolidation) or below the low of the breakout candle.\n    *   A tighter stop could be just below 258-260 if the breakout confirms and retests the level.\n    *   A wider, more conservative stop would be below the lower trendline of the ascending flag (around 245).\n*   **Target Levels (Bullish Trade):**\n    *   **Target 1:** ~275 (next major resistance, aligns with the projected move from the flag pole ~260 + 15 = 275).\n    *   **Target 2:** ~315 - 320 (long-term resistance, if momentum sustains).\n*   **Stop Loss (Bearish Trade):** Place stop-loss just above the 245 or 250 level if 240 breaks down.\n*   **Target Levels (Bearish Trade):**\n    *   **Target 1:** ~235 (first minor support).\n    *   **Target 2:** Potentially lower if 235 fails, looking for prior structure lows if any.\n\n### **Pattern Failure Risk:**\n\n*   **False Bullish Breakout:** The price could briefly move above ~260 and the flag's upper trendline but then quickly reverse and fall back inside the channel or below 260. To manage this, wait for a confirmed daily close above the resistance and volume confirmation.\n*   **Bullish Flag Failure to Launch:** The price fails to break above 260 and instead breaks down below the lower trendline of the ascending flag. This would invalidate the bullish continuation and indicate a potential retest of the ~240 support. If 240 then fails, it would be a significant bearish signal.\n\n### **Trading Strategy:**\n\nThe current market is at a critical juncture for Wipro, consolidating within a potential bullish continuation pattern right below a significant resistance level.\n\n*   **Primary Strategy (Continuation):** The most probable continuation scenario is a **bullish breakout** from the ascending flag/channel. Traders should wait for a clear and confirmed breakout above the **~260** confluence zone (flag upper trendline + horizontal resistance). This offers the best risk/reward for a long trade.\n*   **Alternative Strategy (Reversal/Failure):** If the price fails to break above 260 and instead breaks down below the lower trendline of the ascending flag (approx. 245-248), it signals a potential failure of the bullish pattern. Traders should then monitor the **~240** support level closely. A confirmed breakdown below 240 would indicate a reversal of the recent bounce and likely continuation of the larger downtrend, opening opportunities for short positions.\n*   **Patience is Key:** Given the current consolidation and the significance of the 258-260 resistance, patience is advised to wait for a clear resolution of the pattern.\n\n### **Confidence Level:**\n\n**Medium-High.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe patterns identified are relatively clear, especially the current ascending channel (bullish flag). The confluence of the pattern's upper boundary with a strong, historically tested horizontal resistance level at ~258-260 adds significant reliability to potential breakout signals. The prior bearish flag also demonstrated good reliability. The primary uncertainty lies in the resolution of the current consolidation at a critical resistance point. Volume confirmation on any breakout will be crucial to elevate the confidence level to high.", "summary": {"overall_signal": "neutral", "signal_strength": "moderate", "bullish_percentage": 35.294117647058826, "bearish_percentage": 41.17647058823529, "neutral_percentage": 23.52941176470588}}
