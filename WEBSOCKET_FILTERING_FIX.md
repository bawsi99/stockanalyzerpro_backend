# WebSocket Filtering Fix

## Problem Description

The backend service was experiencing an issue where multiple WebSocket connections were receiving data for ALL subscribed tokens, regardless of their specific subscriptions. This meant that:

- If Client A subscribed to RELIANCE (token 738561)
- And Client B subscribed to NIFTY DIV OPPS 50 (token 257033)
- Both clients would receive data for BOTH tokens

This was causing unnecessary data transmission and potential confusion for frontend applications.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a flawed subscription management architecture:

### 1. **Global Zerodha Subscription Management**
- Each WebSocket connection was independently managing the global Zerodha WebSocket subscription
- When a client subscribed to new tokens, it would unsubscribe from previous tokens and subscribe to new ones
- This affected ALL other clients since there was only one global Zerodha connection

### 2. **Broadcasting to All Clients**
- The `live_pubsub.publish()` method was sending data to ALL connected clients
- Filtering was happening at the client level, but data was still being sent to everyone
- This resulted in unnecessary network traffic and processing

### 3. **No Per-Token Subscription Tracking**
- There was no centralized tracking of which clients were subscribed to which tokens
- The system couldn't efficiently route data to only the relevant clients

## Solution Implementation

### 1. **Centralized Subscription Management**

Added new fields to the `LiveDataPubSub` class:

```python
class LiveDataPubSub:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing fields ...
        
        # NEW: Centralized subscription management
        self.token_subscribers = {}  # token -> set of queues
        self.global_subscribed_tokens = set()  # All tokens currently subscribed to Zerodha
```

### 2. **Smart Data Routing**

Modified the `publish()` method to only send data to relevant clients:

```python
async def publish(self, data):
    token = data.get('token')
    
    # NEW: Only send to clients subscribed to this specific token
    target_queues = set()
    if token and token in self.token_subscribers:
        target_queues = self.token_subscribers[token].copy()
    elif data.get('type') == 'candle':  # For candle data, check timeframe subscribers
        # ... timeframe-based routing logic ...
    else:
        # For other data types, send to all clients (fallback)
        target_queues = set(self.clients.keys())
    
    # Send only to relevant clients
    for queue in target_queues:
        # ... existing filtering and throttling logic ...
```

### 3. **Automatic Token Management**

Added helper methods to manage Zerodha subscriptions automatically:

```python
async def _subscribe_to_zerodha(self, tokens):
    """Subscribe to tokens in Zerodha WebSocket if not already subscribed."""
    new_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in self.global_subscribed_tokens]
    if new_tokens:
        # Subscribe to new tokens
        zerodha_ws_client.subscribe(int_tokens)
        self.global_subscribed_tokens.update(new_tokens)

async def _unsubscribe_from_zerodha(self, tokens):
    """Unsubscribe from tokens in Zerodha WebSocket if no clients are subscribed."""
    # Only unsubscribe if no clients are subscribed to these tokens
    # ... unsubscribe logic ...
```

### 4. **Enhanced Filter Management**

Updated the `update_filter()` method to track token subscriptions:

```python
async def update_filter(self, queue, **kwargs):
    # ... existing filter update logic ...
    
    # Update token subscriptions
    new_tokens = filter_.get('tokens', set())
    
    # Remove old token subscriptions
    tokens_to_unsubscribe = old_tokens - new_tokens
    for token in tokens_to_unsubscribe:
        if token in self.token_subscribers:
            self.token_subscribers[token].discard(queue)
            # If no more subscribers, unsubscribe from Zerodha
            if not self.token_subscribers[token]:
                await self._unsubscribe_from_zerodha([token])
    
    # Add new token subscriptions
    tokens_to_subscribe = new_tokens - old_tokens
    for token in tokens_to_subscribe:
        if token not in self.token_subscribers:
            self.token_subscribers[token] = set()
        self.token_subscribers[token].add(queue)
        # If this is a new token globally, subscribe to it
        if token not in self.global_subscribed_tokens:
            await self._subscribe_to_zerodha([token])
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. **Efficient Data Routing**
- Data is only sent to clients that are actually subscribed to the relevant tokens
- Reduces unnecessary network traffic and processing

### 2. **Centralized Subscription Management**
- Single source of truth for token subscriptions
- Automatic cleanup when clients disconnect
- No more conflicts between different WebSocket connections

### 3. **Automatic Resource Management**
- Tokens are automatically unsubscribed from Zerodha when no clients need them
- Prevents unnecessary API calls and reduces costs

### 4. **Better Monitoring**
- Enhanced connection statistics show token subscription details
- Easier to debug and monitor the system

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_websocket_filtering.py`) has been created to verify the fix:

```bash
cd backend
python test_websocket_filtering.py
```

The test verifies that:
- Clients only receive data for tokens they're subscribed to
- Multiple clients can subscribe to different tokens without interference
- Clients can subscribe to multiple tokens and receive all relevant data

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- The fix is fully backward compatible
- Existing frontend code doesn't need any changes
- The WebSocket API remains the same

### Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Reduced network traffic and processing
- **Positive**: Better resource utilization
- **Neutral**: Minimal additional memory usage for subscription tracking

### Monitoring
- New connection statistics available via `/ws/connections` endpoint
- Enhanced logging for subscription management
- Better visibility into token subscription patterns

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/data_service.py`**
   - Updated `LiveDataPubSub` class with centralized subscription management
   - Modified `publish()` method for smart data routing
   - Enhanced `update_filter()` method for token tracking
   - Removed individual token management from WebSocket endpoint

2. **`backend/api.py`**

   - Ensured consistency between both services

3. **`backend/test_websocket_filtering.py`** (New)
   - Comprehensive test suite for WebSocket filtering
   - Validates the fix works correctly

4. **`backend/WEBSOCKET_FILTERING_FIX.md`** (New)
   - This documentation file

## Future Enhancements

1. **Token-based Rate Limiting**
   - Implement per-token rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **Subscription Analytics**
   - Track popular tokens and subscription patterns
   - Optimize resource allocation based on usage

3. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Support for more complex subscription patterns
   - Conditional subscriptions based on market conditions

4. **Load Balancing**
   - Distribute subscriptions across multiple Zerodha connections
   - Handle connection failures gracefully

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the core issue of data leakage between WebSocket clients while maintaining full backward compatibility. The solution is efficient, scalable, and provides better resource management. The centralized subscription management ensures that each client only receives the data they're actually subscribed to, significantly improving the system's performance and reliability.
