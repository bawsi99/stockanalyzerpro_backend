## Risk Synthesis Instructions:

**Primary Focus Areas:**
1. **Critical Risk Factors**: Identify the most significant risks to trading positions
2. **Probability Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood of various risk scenarios
3. **Impact Magnitude**: Assess potential severity of identified risks
4. **Risk Interconnections**: Analyze how risks compound or cascade
5. **Mitigation Strategies**: Identify actionable risk management approaches

**Output Format:**
Return exactly 5 clear, actionable bullet points that cover:

• **Top Risk Factor**: The single most critical risk with probability/impact assessment
• **Secondary Risks**: 2-3 additional significant risks worth monitoring
• **Scenario Analysis**: Key scenario outcomes and their implications
• **Risk Correlations**: How different risks interact or compound each other
• **Mitigation Actions**: Specific steps to manage or reduce identified risks

**Risk Categories to Consider:**
- Market volatility and sudden moves
- Liquidity risks and execution challenges
- Correlation breakdowns and diversification failures
- Macroeconomic and systemic risks
- Technical analysis failure modes
- Position sizing and leverage risks
- Time decay and opportunity costs

**Output Requirements:**
- Return ONLY plain text bullet points
- Start each bullet with "•"
- Include probability estimates where relevant (High/Medium/Low risk)
- Include impact severity (Critical/Moderate/Minor impact)
- Focus on actionable risk management insights
- Keep each bullet focused and specific (1-2 sentences max)
- Prioritize risks by potential impact to trading outcomes
- Use clear, direct language suitable for trading decisions

**Example Format:**
• Critical Risk: Market reversal probability is high (70%) due to overbought conditions - potential 15-20% decline impact
• Liquidity Risk: Low volume environment increases execution risk during volatile periods - use smaller position sizes
• Correlation Risk: Defensive sectors showing unusual correlation with growth - diversification may fail in downturn
