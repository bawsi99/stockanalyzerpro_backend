# Prompt Formatting Fixes Summary

## Problem Description

The system was experiencing debug errors in prompt formatting:

```
[DEBUG] Prompt formatting failed: '\n  "volume_anomalies"', using fallback
[DEBUG] Prompt formatting failed: '\n  "timeframe_analysis"', using fallback
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The formatting failures were caused by **unescaped curly braces** in the JSON schema sections of prompt templates. When Python's `str.format()` method tried to process these templates, it encountered unescaped `{` and `}` characters in the JSON examples and treated them as format placeholders, causing formatting failures.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `backend/prompts/optimized_volume_analysis.txt`
**Problem**: JSON schema contained unescaped curly braces in the `volume_anomalies` section and other nested objects.

**Fix**: Escaped all curly braces by doubling them (`{` → `{{`, `}` → `}}`)

### 2. `backend/prompts/optimized_mtf_comparison.txt`
**Problem**: JSON schema contained unescaped curly braces in the `timeframe_analysis` section and other nested objects.

**Fix**: Escaped all curly braces by doubling them (`{` → `{{`, `}` → `}}`)

### 3. `backend/prompts/optimized_pattern_analysis.txt`
**Problem**: JSON schema contained unescaped curly braces in pattern analysis sections.

**Fix**: Escaped all curly braces by doubling them (`{` → `{{`, `}` → `}}`)

### 4. `backend/prompts/optimized_technical_overview.txt`
**Problem**: JSON schema contained unescaped curly braces in technical analysis sections.

**Fix**: Escaped all curly braces by doubling them (`{` → `{{`, `}` → `}}`)

## Files Already Correct

The following templates already had properly escaped curly braces:
- `backend/prompts/optimized_indicators_summary.txt` ✅
- `backend/prompts/optimized_final_decision.txt` ✅
- `backend/prompts/optimized_continuation_levels.txt` ✅ (no JSON schema)
- `backend/prompts/optimized_reversal_patterns.txt` ✅ (no JSON schema)

## Technical Details

### The Problem
When using Python's `str.format()` method, curly braces `{` and `}` are treated as special characters for variable substitution. In JSON schemas within prompt templates, these characters need to be escaped.

### The Solution
In Python string formatting, curly braces are escaped by doubling them:
- `{` becomes `{{`
- `}` becomes `}}`

### Example Fix
**Before (Problematic)**:
```json
{
  "volume_anomalies": {
    "unusual_spikes": [
      {
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "volume_ratio": 0.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```json
{{
  "volume_anomalies": {{
    "unusual_spikes": [
      {{
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "volume_ratio": 0.0
      }}
    ]
  }}
}}
```

## Verification

The fixes were verified using the `simple_test_fixes.py` script, which confirmed:
- ✅ Volume Analysis JSON Error: `'\n  "volume_anomalies"'` - **FIXED**
- ✅ MTF Comparison JSON Error: `'\n  "timeframe_analysis"'` - **FIXED**
- ✅ All prompt formatting tests pass
- ✅ All edge cases handled gracefully

## Impact

These fixes resolve the prompt formatting failures that were causing the system to fall back to safer formatting methods. The LLM responses should now be more consistent and the debug error messages should no longer appear.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always escape curly braces in JSON schemas within prompt templates
2. Use `{{` and `}}` instead of `{` and `}` in JSON examples
3. Test prompt formatting with problematic context data
4. Review prompt templates for unescaped curly braces before deployment
