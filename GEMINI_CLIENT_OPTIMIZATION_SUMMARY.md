## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Optimized)
```python
from gemini.gemini_client import GeminiClient

client = GeminiClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Single stock analysis with retry and parallel execution
result, ind_summary, chart_insights = await client.analyze_stock(
    symbol="RELIANCE",
    indicators=indicators_data,
    chart_paths=chart_paths,
    period=30,
    interval="1D"
)
```

### Batch Analysis (New Feature)
```python
# Analyze multiple stocks in parallel
stock_analyses = [
    ("RELIANCE", indicators1, chart_paths1, 30, "1D", ""),
    ("TCS", indicators2, chart_paths2, 30, "1D", ""),
    ("INFY", indicators3, chart_paths3, 30, "1D", ""),
    ("HDFC", indicators4, chart_paths4, 30, "1D", "")
]

results = await client.analyze_multiple_stocks_parallel(stock_analyses)
```

### Enhanced Analysis with Calculations
```python
# Enhanced analysis with mathematical validation
result, ind_summary, chart_insights = await client.analyze_stock_with_enhanced_calculations(
    symbol="RELIANCE",
    indicators=indicators_data,
    chart_paths=chart_paths,
    period=30,
    interval="1D"
)
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Retry Mechanism Logging
```
[RETRY] LLM call: Attempt 1/3 failed: Quota exceeded for this API key
[RETRY] LLM call: Retrying in 0.10 seconds...
[RETRY] LLM call: Error classified as 'quota_exceeded', using specific retry config
```

### Async Performance Logging
```
[ASYNC] Starting 4 chart analysis tasks in parallel...
[ASYNC] Completed 4 chart analysis tasks in 3.45 seconds
[ASYNC] Starting final decision analysis...
[ASYNC] Final decision analysis completed in 1.23 seconds
```

### Batch Analysis Logging
```
[BATCH-ASYNC] Starting parallel analysis of 4 stocks...
[BATCH-ASYNC] Completed parallel analysis of 4 stocks in 10.01 seconds
```

## Configuration Options

### Retry Configuration
```python
from gemini.error_utils import RetryConfig

# Custom retry configuration
custom_config = RetryConfig(
    max_retries=5,
    base_delay=2.0,
    max_delay=60.0,
    exponential_base=3.0,
    jitter=True
)
```

### Error Classification
The system automatically classifies errors into:
- **Quota Exceeded**: Rate limiting and quota errors
- **Server Errors**: Internal server errors, service unavailable
- **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts, network issues
- **Authentication Errors**: Invalid API keys, unauthorized access
- **Request Errors**: Malformed requests, invalid parameters
