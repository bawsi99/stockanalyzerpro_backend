For stock market prediction, you should try progressively more complex models. Here are good candidates beyond logistic regression:

## Tree-Based Models (Start Here)
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier

# Random Forest - handles non-linearity well
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Gradient Boosting - often performs well on tabular data
gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# XGBoost - industry standard for tabular data
xgb = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# LightGBM - faster alternative to XGBoost
lgb = LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
```
## Support Vector Machines
```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# SVM with RBF kernel - good for non-linear patterns
svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=42)
```
## Neural Networks
```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Multi-layer perceptron
mlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), max_iter=500, random_state=42)
```
## Ensemble Methods
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

# Combine multiple models
ensemble = VotingClassifier([
    ('rf', RandomForestClassifier(100)),
    ('xgb', XGBClassifier(100)),
    ('lgb', LGBMClassifier(100))
], voting='soft')
```
**Recommendation**: Start with XGBoost or LightGBM as they typically perform best on financial time series data with technical indicators.

Would you like me to update your training script to compare these models?
