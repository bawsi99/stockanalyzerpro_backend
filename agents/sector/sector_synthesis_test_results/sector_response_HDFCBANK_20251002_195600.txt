COMPLETE LLM RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------
• Performance Positioning: Nifty Private Bank sector outperformed the market by +2.0% over the last 12 months, indicating prior strength.
• Beta Analysis: The sector's market beta of 1.0 over 12 months suggests it moves largely in line with the broader market, offering no defensive or aggressive sensitivity.
• Rotation Status: Currently, the Nifty Private Bank sector is in a lagging rotation stage with -0.6% momentum over 3 months, signaling it is rotating out of favor.
• Strategic Implication: Despite long-term outperformance, the current lagging rotation and negative momentum suggest caution or a potential underweighting of the sector.
