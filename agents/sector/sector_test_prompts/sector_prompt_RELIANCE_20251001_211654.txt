## Sector Synthesis Instructions:

**Primary Focus Areas:**
1. **Relative Performance**: Compare stock performance vs sector and market benchmarks
2. **Beta Relationships**: Analyze sensitivity to sector and market movements
3. **Sector Rotation**: Identify current rotation trends and implications
4. **Performance Attribution**: Determine if outperformance is stock-specific or sector-driven
5. **Rotation Timing**: Assess whether sector is in favor or rotating out

**Output Format:**
Return exactly 4 clear, actionable bullet points that cover:

• **Performance Positioning**: Stock's relative performance vs sector and market
• **Beta Analysis**: Beta relationships and sensitivity implications  
• **Rotation Status**: Current sector rotation trend and stage
• **Strategic Implication**: Key takeaway for trading/investment decisions

**Key Metrics to Analyze:**
- Stock vs Sector outperformance/underperformance
- Stock vs Market (SPY/Nifty) outperformance/underperformance  
- Sector Beta (sensitivity to sector moves)
- Market Beta (sensitivity to overall market)
- Sector rotation momentum and direction
- Relative strength trends

**Output Requirements:**
- Return ONLY plain text bullet points
- Start each bullet with "•"
- Include specific performance percentages where available
- Include beta values where relevant
- Focus on actionable sector-based insights
- Keep each bullet concise but informative (1-2 sentences max)
- Prioritize insights by trading/investment relevance
- Use clear, direct language suitable for portfolio decisions

**Example Format:**
• Performance Edge: Stock outperforming sector by +5.2% and market by +8.7% over past month - strong relative momentum
• Beta Profile: Sector beta of 1.3 indicates high sensitivity to sector moves; market beta of 0.9 shows defensive characteristics
• Rotation Trend: Technology sector in strong rotation favor with institutional inflows - tailwind for continued outperformance  
• Strategic Advantage: Stock-specific strength combined with sector tailwinds creates favorable risk/reward setup
