4. **Level Determination**: Determine confirmation and invalidation levels
5. **Risk Management**: Provide risk management recommendations

## Key Analysis Points:
- Divergence patterns (bullish/bearish) and their strength
- Double top/bottom pattern completion and confirmation
- Confluence between divergences and reversal patterns
- Volume confirmation of reversal signals
- Pattern reliability and false signal risk
- Potential reversal entry and exit points
- Risk management levels for reversal trades
