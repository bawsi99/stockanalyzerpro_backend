## 🚀 **Usage Guide**

### **1. With LLM Client (Enhanced Mode)**
```python
from agents.patterns.pattern_recognition.processor import PatternRecognitionProcessor

# Initialize with LLM client for multi-stage processing
processor = PatternRecognitionProcessor(llm_client=your_llm_client)

# Run analysis - automatically uses multi-stage LLM
result = await processor.analyze_async(
    stock_data=stock_data,
    indicators=indicators,
    context="RELIANCE NSE analysis"
)

# Access results
technical_confidence = result['confidence_score']        # Technical analysis confidence
final_confidence = result['final_confidence_score']     # Enhanced by multi-stage LLM
llm_enhanced = result['llm_enhanced']                   # True
multi_stage_results = result['multi_stage_llm_analysis'] # Detailed stage results
```

### **2. Without LLM Client (Standard Mode)**
```python
# Initialize without LLM client for standard processing
processor = PatternRecognitionProcessor(llm_client=None)

# Run analysis - uses only technical analysis
result = await processor.analyze_async(
    stock_data=stock_data,
    indicators=indicators,
    context="RELIANCE NSE analysis"
)

# Access results
confidence = result['confidence_score']    # Technical analysis only
llm_enhanced = result['llm_enhanced']      # False
```

### **3. Integration with Pattern Agents**
```python
from agents.patterns.patterns_agents import PatternAgentsOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator with LLM client
orchestrator = PatternAgentsOrchestrator(gemini_client=your_llm_client)

# Run comprehensive pattern analysis
# Pattern recognition agent will automatically use multi-stage LLM
results = await orchestrator.analyze_patterns_comprehensive(
    symbol="RELIANCE",
    stock_data=stock_data,
    indicators=indicators
)

# Access pattern recognition results with multi-stage LLM
pattern_recognition_result = results.individual_results['pattern_recognition']
if pattern_recognition_result.success:
    analysis_data = pattern_recognition_result.analysis_data
    llm_enhanced = analysis_data.get('llm_enhanced', False)
    if llm_enhanced:
        multi_stage_data = analysis_data['multi_stage_llm_analysis']
```

---

## 🎛️ **Configuration Options**

### **Stage Configuration**
```python
# Modify stage settings in MultiStageLLMProcessor
stages = {
    'market_structure': {
        'enabled': True,      # Enable/disable stage
        'timeout': 30,        # Timeout in seconds
        'max_retries': 2      # Maximum retry attempts
    },
    # ... other stages
}
```

### **LLM Client Requirements**
The multi-stage processor expects an LLM client with:
```python
async def generate(self, prompt: str, enable_code_execution: bool = False) -> str:
    # Should return string response to the prompt
    pass
```
